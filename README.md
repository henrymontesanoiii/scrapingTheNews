## Basic Functionality
### H-IGN is a scraping application utilizing Axios & Cheerio to scrape article information for the IGN News webpage, including article title, article summary, and article link.
### Utilizing Moongoose with MongoDB, H-IGN stores each article information within a database. When a user clicks the article's header, a note will pop-up where the user can input a Note Title and Comment unique to that specific article. If the user saves that note, the note's i.d. is linked to that article's i.d. and also saved to the database.  
### When the same article header is clicked again, the database will find which note i.d. is linked to that article and display the note data from the database (the note content can continually be overwritten while still being linked to that specific article.)
